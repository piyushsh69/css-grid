<!-- In CSS Grid, justify-items and justify-self are properties that control the horizontal alignment of grid items within a
grid container. Let's break down the differences between these two properties using code examples.

justify-items:
The justify-items property is used to set the default horizontal alignment for all grid items within the grid container.
It affects all direct children of the grid container. -->

<div class="grid-container-1">
    <div class="grid-item-1">1</div>
    <div class="grid-item-1">2</div>
    <div class="grid-item-1">3</div>
</div>

<!-- In this example, all grid items within the .grid-container will be horizontally centered due to the justify-items:
center; property.

justify-self:
On the other hand, the justify-self property is used to override the horizontal alignment of a specific grid item. It
allows you to individually control the horizontal alignment for each grid item. -->

<div class="grid-container-2">
    <div class="grid-item-2">1</div>
    <div class="grid-item-2">2</div>
    <div class="grid-item-2">3</div>
</div>

<!-- In this example, all grid items will still have a default horizontal alignment based on the grid container's
justify-items property. However, the specific grid item with the class .grid-item will have its horizontal alignment set
to the end, overriding the default alignment.

In summary, justify-items sets the default horizontal alignment for all grid items within a grid container, while
justify-self allows you to individually override the default alignment for specific grid items. -->
